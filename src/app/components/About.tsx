                My name is <a href="#" className="font-bold">Juan Alberto Lagunas-Lara</a>, but to my family, I&apos;m known as Betillo or Tillo (&quot;Tee-yo&quot;).
                I&apos;m an enthusiastic electrical engineering student who&apos;s deeply into robotics and passionate about empowering my Mexican community. I&apos;ve always been curious about how things work, and I love learning as much as I enjoy sharing what I&apos;ve picked up along the way.

                If you&apos;re here to connect, collaborate, or just see what I&apos;m up to, then you&apos;re in the right place.
