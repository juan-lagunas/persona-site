                    In high school, my priorities were simple: study just enough to keep the grades up, and then dive back into video games whenever I wasn&apos;t working. But something changed this past year. I stumbled upon Harvard&apos;s CS50 course, and to my surprise, I got hooked.

                    Since then, I&apos;ve explored even more through MIT&apos;s OpenCourseWare. It&apos;s been an unexpected journey, but a rewarding one. I&apos;m excited to keep leveling up my knowledge and see where this new passion takes me!

                        Growing up in an immigrant family, I often found myself navigating school and planning for the future without much guidance. I didn&apos;t have someone to help me understand my academic options or prepare me for life after high school.

                        Recently, I had the opportunity to help my younger brother with his high school programming class. It felt incredibly rewarding to provide him with the guidance I lacked. That experience sparked something in meâ€”a passion for teaching and a desire to make a positive impact.
