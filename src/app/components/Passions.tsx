                    In high school, my priorities were pretty clear: study just enough to keep the grades up, and then dive back into the latest video game. But over the past year, something shifted. I found myself drawn to learning in a way I never expected.

                    It started with Harvard&apos;s CS50 course, which was so engaging that I wanted more. That led me to explore MIT&apos;s OpenCourseWare, where I&apos;ve been diving into subjects I never imagined I&apos;d enjoy. It&apos;s been a wild ride, and I&apos;m excited to see where this newfound passion for learning takes me next!

                    <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">My Journey from Student to Teacher: Finding Purpose in Helping Others</h1>
                        Growing up in an immigrant family, I didn&apos;t have much academic support. Schoolwork often felt like a solo mission, and I had to figure things out on my own. It wasn&apos;t always easy, and that experience shaped my perspective on education.

                        Recently, I had the chance to help my brother with his high school programming class. What started as a way to lend a hand turned into something more meaningful. I discovered a passion for teaching. Seeing him grasp difficult concepts and succeed was incredibly rewarding, and it made me realize how much I enjoy helping others learn.

                        This experience opened my eyes to the impact that a little support can have. I want to do more of thisâ€”not just for my brother, but for others who might be facing the same challenges I did growing up. I want to offer the help that I didn&apos;t have.

                        So, if you&apos;re struggling with school or need some guidance, feel free to reach out.
