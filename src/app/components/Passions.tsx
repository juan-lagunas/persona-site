                    In high school, my priorities were pretty clear: study just enough to keep the grades up, and then dive back into the latest video game. But something changed this past year. I stumbled upon Harvard&apos;s CS50 course, and to my surprise, I got hooked—not on a new game, but on learning.

                    Since then, I&apos;ve explored even more through MIT&apos;s OpenCourseWare. Who knew that taking courses could actually be fun? It&apos;s been an unexpected journey, but a rewarding one. I&apos;m excited to keep leveling up my knowledge and see where this new passion takes me!

                    <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">My Journey from Student to Teacher: Finding Purpose in Helping Others</h1>
                        Growing up in an immigrant family, I didn&apos;t have much academic support. Schoolwork often felt like a solo mission, and I had to figure things out on my own. It wasn&apos;t always easy, and that experience shaped my perspective on education.

                        Recently, I had the chance to help my brother with his high school programming class. What started as a way to lend a hand turned into something more meaningful. I discovered a passion for teaching. Seeing him grasp difficult concepts and succeed was incredibly rewarding, and it made me realize how much I enjoy helping others learn.

                        This experience opened my eyes to the impact that a little support can have. I want to do more of this—not just for my brother, but for others who might be facing the same challenges I did growing up. I want to offer the help that I didn&apos;t have.

                        So, if you&apos;re struggling with school or need some guidance, feel free to reach out.
