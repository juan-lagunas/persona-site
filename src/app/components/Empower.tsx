                Now that I&apos;ve found my purpose, I&apos;m dedicated to uplifting our Mexican community by helping students who face the same challenges I once did. I believe that education is the key to opening doors, and I&apos;m here to make sure those doors are wide open for anyone who wants to walk through them.
                <br />
                <br />
                My mission is to be that support systemâ€”whether it&apos;s through tutoring, mentorship, or simply a listening ear. Together, we can break down barriers and show that our community&apos;s potential is limitless. Because when we lift each other up, we all rise higher.
