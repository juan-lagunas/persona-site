                    I come from a big Mexican family, and I&apos;m incredibly proud of the courage my parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles showed when they made the journey to the United States. My parents met in school back in Mexico, but they never had the chance to finish their education. Because of that, I often found myself navigating school and planning for the future without much guidance.

                    Recently, I had the chance to help my younger brother with his high school programming class. Being able to provide him with the support I didn&apos;t have growing up was incredibly rewarding. That experience lit a fire in meâ€”a passion for teaching and a deep desire to make a positive impact on others who face similar challenges.
